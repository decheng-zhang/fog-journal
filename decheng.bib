	Abstract = {The runtime management of Internet of Things (IoT) oriented applications deployed in multi-clouds is a complex issue due to the highly heterogeneous and dynamic execution environment. To effectively cope with such an environment, the cross-layer and multi-cloud effects should be taken into account and a decentralized self-adaptation is a promising solution to maintain and evolve the applications for quality assurance. An important issue to be tackled towards realizing this solution is the uncertainty effect of the adaptation, which may cause negative impact to the other layers or even clouds. In this paper, we tackle such an issue from the planning perspective, since an inappropriate planning strategy can fail the adaptation outcome. Therefore, we present an architectural model for decentralized self-adaptation to support the cross-layer and multi-cloud environment. We also propose a planning model and method to enable the decentralized decision making. The planning is formulated as a Reinforcement Learning problem and solved using the Q-learning algorithm. Through simulation experiments, we conduct a study to assess the effectiveness and sensitivity of the proposed planning approach. The results show that our approach can potentially reduce the negative impact on the cross-layer and multi-cloud environment.},

	Abstract = {A novel value-estimation function method for global optimization problems with inequality constraints is proposed in this paper. The value-estimation function formulation is an auxiliary unconstrained optimization problem with a univariate parameter that represents an estimated optimal value of the objective function of the original optimization problem. A solution is optimal to the original problem if and only if it is also optimal to the auxiliary unconstrained optimization with the parameter set at the optimal objective value of the original problem, which turns out to be the unique root of a basic value-estimation function. A logarithmic-exponential value-estimation function formulation is further developed to acquire computational tractability and efficiency. The optimal objective value of the original problem as well as the optimal solution are sought iteratively by applying either a generalized Newton method or a bisection method to the logarithmic-exponential value-estimation function formulation. The convergence properties of the solution algorithms guarantee the identification of an approximate optimal solution of the original problem, up to any predetermined degree of accuracy, within a finite number of iterations.},

In this paper we describe and apply a three-step approach to map SLA and QoS requirements of business processes to such infrastructures. We start with formalization of service capabilities and business process requirements. We compare them and, if we detect a performance or reliability gap, we dynamically improve performance of individual services deployed in grid and cloud computing environments. Here we employ translucent replication of services. An experimental evaluation in Amazon EC2 verified our approach.},

	Abstract = {Cloud infrastructures are designed to simultaneously service many, diverse applications that consist of collections of Virtual Machines (VMs). The placement policy used to map applications onto physical servers has important effects in terms of application performance and resource efficiency. We propose enhancing placement policies with network-aware optimizations, trying to simultaneously improve application performance, resource efficiency and power efficiency. The per-application placement decision is formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem (minimizing communication cost and the number of physical servers on which an application runs) whose solution is searched using evolutionary techniques. We have tested three multi-objective optimization algorithms with problem-specific crossover and mutation operators. Simulation-based experiments demonstrate how, in comparison with classic placement techniques, a low-cost optimization results in improved assignments of resources, making applications run faster and reducing the energy consumed by the data center. This is beneficial for both cloud clients and cloud providers.},

We model this problem as a biobjective (cost-coverage) uncapacitated facility location problem (BOUFLP). We designed and implemented three different algorithms for the BOUFLP that are able to obtain a good approximation of the Pareto frontier. We designed an algorithm based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm; an algorithm based on the Pareto Archive Evolution Strategy; and an algorithm based on mathematical programming. We developed a random problem generator for testing and comparison using as reference the Colombian coffee supply network with 29 depots and 47 purchasing centers. We compared the algorithms based on the quality of the approximation to the Pareto frontier using a nondominated space metric inspired on Zitzler and Thiele's. We used the mathematical programming-based algorithm to identify unique tradeoff opportunities for the reconfiguration of the Colombian coffee supply network. Finally, we illustrate an extension of the mathematical programming-based algorithm to perform scenario analysis for a set of uncapacitated location problems found in the literature.},

	Abstract = {The present paper attempts to explore the integration of production, distribution and logistics activities at the strategic decision making level where, the objective is to design a multi-echelon supply chain network considering agility as a key design criterion. The design network conceived here addresses a class of five echelons of supply chains including suppliers, plants, distribution centers, cross-docks and customer zones. The problem has been mathematically formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims to minimize the cost (fixed and variable) and maximizes the plant flexibility and volume flexibility. The notion of cross-dock has been introduced as an intermediate level between distribution centers and customer zones to increase the profitability of manufacturing and service industries. In order to solve the underlying problem, a novel algorithm entitled hybrid taguchi-particle swarm optimization (HTPSO) has been proposed that incorporates the characteristics of statistical design of experiments and random search techniques. The main idea is to integrate the fundamentals of taguchi method i.e. orthogonal array and signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the PSO meta-heuristic to minimize the effect of the causes of variations. The proposed model has been authenticated by undertaking problem instances of varying size. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to validate the same and also the efficacy of the proposed HTPSO algorithm. The results obtained reveal that proposed solution methodology is an effective approach to solve the underlying problem.},

@article{Benson1998,
	Abstract = {Various difficulties have been encountered in using decision set-based vector maximization methods to solve a multiple objective linear programming problem (MOLP). Motivated by these difficulties, some researchers in recent years have suggested that outcome set-based approaches should instead be developed and used to solve problem (MOLP). In this article, we present a finite algorithm, called the Outer Approximation Algorithm, for generating the set of all efficient extreme points in the outcome set of problem (MOLP). To our knowledge, the Outer Approximation Algorithm is the first algorithm capable of generating this set. As a by-product, the algorithm also generates the weakly efficient outcome set of problem (MOLP). Because it works in the outcome set rather than in the decision set of problem (MOLP), the Outer Approximation Algorithm has several advantages over decision set-based algorithms. It is also relatively easy to implement. Preliminary computational results for a set of randomly-generated problems are reported. These results tangibly demonstrate the usefulness of using the outcome set approach of the Outer Approximation Algorithm instead of a decision set-based approach.},

In the first phase, the set of supported efficient solutions is determined by optimizing a parameterized single-objective knapsack problem. Two versions are proposed for a second phase, determining the non-supported efficient solutions: both versions are Branch and Bound approaches, but one is ``breadth first'', while the other is ``depth first''. Extensive numerical experiments have been realized to compare the results of both methods.},

The heuristics for all the three problems guarantee error ratios no worse than the logarithm of the number of customer points. The derivation of the heuristics is based on the presentation of all types of median problems discussed as a set covering problem.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental facility location problem is to choose the location of facilities, such as industrial plants and warehouses, to minimize the cost of satisfying the demand for some commodity. There are associated costs for locating the facilities, as well as transportation costs for distributing the commodities. We assume that the transportation costs form a metric. This problem is commonly referred to as the uncapacitated facility location problem. Application to bank account location and clustering, as well as many related pieces of work, are discussed by Cornuejols, Nemhauser, and Wolsey. Recently, the first constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem was obtained by Shmoys, Tardos, and Aardal. We show that a simple greedy heuristic combined with the algorithm by Shmoys, Tardos, and Aardal, can be used to obtain an approximation guarantee of 2.408. We discuss a few variants of the problem, demonstrating better approximation factors for restricted versions of the problem. We also show that the problem is max SNP-hard. However, the inapproximability constants derived from the max SNP hardness are very close to one. By relating this problem to Set Cover, we prove a lower bound of 1.463 on the best possible approximation ratio, assuming NP is not an element of DTIME[n(O(log log n))].
